# SP-colab-notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Google Colab notebooks for Image Denoising tasks. The notebooks demonstrate various denoising techniques using deep learning models like QCNN (Quaternion Convolutional Neural Network) and TCNN (Traditional Convolutional Neural Network). These notebooks are designed to help students and researchers understand and implement denoising models for image denoising tasks.

## Acknowledgments

This repository is based on code from the [QuaternionCNN_Keras](https://github.com/XYZ387/QuaternionCNN_Keras/tree/master) repository. The original work provided the foundational model for **image denoising**, and I have added the **Spatial Attention Module (SAM)** and made several tweaks to improve the model's performance.

Special thanks to the contributors of the original repository for their great work, which laid the groundwork for this project.

## Getting Started

### ðŸ”¹ Open in Google Colab
1. Click on any `.ipynb` file to open it in Google Colab.
2. You can run the notebooks directly from Colab without any installation.
